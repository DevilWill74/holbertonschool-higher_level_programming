# Low-Level Programming in C

This repository contains solutions to low-level programming exercises in C. It focuses on pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Directories
- **`pointers_arrays_strings/`**: Contains exercises related to pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## Files
### Root Directory
- **`0-main.c`**: Main file for testing functions in the `pointers_arrays_strings` directory.

### `pointers_arrays_strings/` Directory
- **`main.h`**: Header file with prototypes for the functions.
- **`0-reset_to_98.c`**: Updates the value of a pointer to an integer to 98.

## How to Compile and Run
1. Compile using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c -o 0-98
